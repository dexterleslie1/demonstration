            Is that Eric Garner worked
            for some time for the Parks and Rec.
            Horticultural Department, which means,
            perhaps, that with his very large hands,
            perhaps, in all likelihood,
            he put gently into the earth
            some plants which, most likely,
            some of them, in all likelihood,
            continue to grow, continue
            to do what such plants do, like house
            and feed small and necessary creatures,
            like being pleasant to touch and smell,
            like converting sunlight
            into food, like making it easier
            for us to breathe.
