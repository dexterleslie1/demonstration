        window vs document onload
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/588040/window-onload-vs-document-onload

        window.onload: By default, it is fired when the entire page loads, including its content (images, CSS, scripts, etc.).
        document.onload: It is called when the DOM is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded.
