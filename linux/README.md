### bash shell设置自动补全

参考
https://www.pix-art.be/post/bash-history-completion

STEP 1: Create .inputrc
vim ~/.inputrc

STEP 2: Paste the following code
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
set completion-ignore-case on

STEP 3: Open a new window

STEP4: Testing
10 commands ago I executed this command "vim ~/.inputrc". Now I would like to repeat it but don't want to look it up in my history or type it all out again. I can now type "vi" and press Arrow Up. And it will auto complete with the last known command that started with "vi" in my case "vim ~/.inputrc".
